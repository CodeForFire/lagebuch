# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project is pre-1.0 — breaking changes may occur in any release; see
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for what that means
once we reach 1.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Search box on the Links tab, and ÖFFNEN now shows and says that it opens the system browser (#262)

### Changed
- CO-Messung: ABBRECHEN in the Wohnung editor now actually discards. Status, CO-Wert,
  Bezeichnung, Bewohnername and Schlüssel are buffered until FERTIG, so an intermediate or
  mistyped ppm reading no longer lands in the Einsatztagebuch. The tile previews the pending
  state while the sidebar is open. (#242)

### Fixed
- Stop a Kraft's Stärke-Historie from duplicating on every save: each save was re-inserting
  the whole edit history on top of what was already on disk, so a file saved N times held N
  copies of every correction. Existing files are deduplicated the next time they are opened. (#279)
- Surface a failed background save (disk full, read-only, locked/corrupt DB) as a persistent
  red banner in the Einsatz workspace instead of silently leaving the incident unsaved (#280)
- Leaving an open Einsatz via the top command bar (ÜBERSICHT, STAMMDATEN, ÖFFNEN, NEUER EINSATZ,
  VERBINDEN) instead of the workspace's own "ZUR STARTSEITE" no longer leaks its subscription to
  the background save-failure store (#280)
- Navigating home no longer leaves the incident workspace running in the background: closing it
  now stops its once-a-second ticker (Atemschutz, Aufgaben, ILS-Erinnerung) and unsubscribes it
  from further changes, and a joined client also drops its host-connection event handlers. (#284)

### Security
- Harden CI workflows: `ci.yml` now runs with read-only `contents` permission and enforces
  `dotnet format` in CI; `claude.yml` only responds to `@claude` mentions from repo owners,
  members and collaborators; Dependabot now tracks the Android and acceptance-test projects'
  own `Directory.Packages.props` files in addition to the root one.
- Attachment names from a joined device can no longer escape the temp directory or smuggle in an
  executable type. A file name is reduced to its last path segment and capped at 255 bytes on the
  way into the domain (and on load, so a name already in a snapshot or file is neutralised too),
  its extension must match the declared file type, ÖFFNEN copies the bytes into a fresh private
  directory under the app's own temp root instead of the shared system temp directory, and the
  desktop launcher refuses anything that is not a regular image or PDF file inside that root. (#285)
- `JsonTrustStore` now takes its lock for reads too, closing a race where the TLS
  certificate-pin check on a join could read the trusted-thumbprint cache while another
  handshake was writing it; the trust file is also now written via a temp file plus rename, so
  a crash mid-write can no longer leave a corrupt `trust.json` behind. Joining another device's
  incident no longer has an "accept any certificate" fallback — a trust store is required, so a
  join is always TLS-pinned. (#286)
- Android: the `FileProvider` now grants access to only its `shared/` and `lagebuch/`
  subdirectories, not the whole cache directory — `import.json`, picked attachments and the
  synced-attachment cache are no longer reachable through a shared or opened URI. A malicious
  content provider's `DISPLAY_NAME` for a picked attachment can no longer escape the app's cache
  directory via `../` path traversal; it is now sanitised to a bare file name with a safe fallback. (#303)
